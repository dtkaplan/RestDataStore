## Background

I'm updating a system for writing, deploying, and scoring exercise sets.  The objectives of the system:


## Subsytems

### 1. Content creation and sharing.
    
a. Provide a relatively easy way for instructors and others to write exercises with technical/mathematical content.
#. Enable easy sharing of such material.
#. Allow authors to use their own tools for revision control and distribution, e.g. git, Dropbox, personal directories in institutional web servers, etc.
    
### 2. An interface to access the exercises and student submissions

a. Easily maintained, updated, and modifiable --- done in R/Shiny
    
### 3. (Somewhat) secure storage of submissions and other information
